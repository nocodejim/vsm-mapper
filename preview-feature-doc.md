## Technical Details

### Security
- Mermaid.js runs with `securityLevel: 'strict'` to prevent XSS attacks
- All user input is properly escaped before rendering
- Content Security Policy (CSP) compatible

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses html2canvas for screenshot functionality

### Performance
- Diagrams render asynchronously to prevent UI blocking
- Zoom transformations use CSS for smooth performance
- Large diagrams may take a moment to render initially

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Won't Open
- Ensure you've generated Mermaid code first
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify Mermaid.js CDN is accessible

### Diagram Not Rendering
- Check if the Mermaid syntax is valid
- Look for error messages in the preview modal
- Try regenerating the diagram code

### Screenshot Not Saving
- Check browser permissions for downloads
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try a different browser if issues persist
- Note: The browser controls where files are saved (not the application)

### Zoom Issues
- If zoom controls are unresponsive, try resetting zoom
- Close and reopen the preview modal
- Check if browser zoom is interfering (reset with Ctrl/Cmd + 0)

## Best Practices

1. **Preview Before Saving**: Always preview your diagram to ensure it looks correct before saving
2. **Use Appropriate Zoom**: Zoom out for large diagrams to see the complete flow
3. **Screenshot for Presentations**: Use the camera feature to capture diagrams for presentations or documentation
4. **Fullscreen for Detail**: Use fullscreen mode when examining complex diagrams

## Limitations

- Maximum zoom level: 400%
- Minimum zoom level: 25%
- PNG exports are limited by browser memory constraints
- Very large diagrams may experience performance issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements under consideration:
- SVG export option
- Pan/drag functionality for large diagrams
- Multiple export resolutions
- Print-friendly view
- Dark mode support
